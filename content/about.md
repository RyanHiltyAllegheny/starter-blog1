## Where did it all begin?

###  Birth of Keg and Burg

Just two average college students with an interests in sharing our favorite songs and artists for you!! Keg and Burg started back in 2019 when the times of effort were free! Entering a new chatper of our lives looking to spread the word of music love. The radio rebels took on a new hobby to learn skill related to media. Getting our first start at Allegheny College with the radio show "10 BELOW" on the WARC 90.3 Meadville radio station. The show consisted of some our personal favorite tunes and discusisons. A question based talk show where two minds colid for a clash of creativity and reality. The show still runs today! But will conclude for the boys shortly after their graduation in May 2022. The direction of the boys and their history of show business is unknown at this point, but hopefully this site will give a place for fans and users alike to interact and continue the love of music and discussion!
